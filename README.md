Course project of DS-GA 1001: Introduction of data science

In our project we have built up a model by supervised learning method to discover relation between 
neighborhood features and high-potential area in New York real estate market. We used Linear SVM as 
baseline model, then improved the performance by testing precision scores of highest investment 
potential class of Decision Tree and SVM with different parameters. The result shows that the East
Queens and North Bronx have high investment potential in records. More detail please refer to [report](https://github.com/Netjimmy/Investment-Potencial-of-NYC-Real-Estate-Market/blob/master/houseeasy-final-report.pdf)
